### About 

A minimal working concept of making AJAX fetch calls to external API [(OMDb)](http://www.omdbapi.com). A practice in making RESTful API calls to server, JSON objects to front-end through Express middleware, along with the use of EJS to render data in Express templates. 

This mini-project allows users to search for a range of movies available within OMBd. After entering a search key, the user is given a number of related movies, providing a movie poster, release year, actors, and plot summary.
